## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes Denmark's housing market using real estate sales data. Leveraging **Google BigQuery** for cloud-based SQL querying and **Power BI** for interactive dashboards, the project offers key insights into trends such as median sales price change, YOY sales growth, and regional housing patterns. This end-to-end data analytics pipeline includes data extraction, transformation, DAX-based modeling, and dashboard deployment.

## üéØ Objectives
- Analyze house sale trends across regions and sales types.
- Understand the impact of time, region, house type, and market factors (interest, inflation, yield) on sales price.
- Build a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to visualize metrics like units sold, sales growth, SQM price, and performance KPIs.
